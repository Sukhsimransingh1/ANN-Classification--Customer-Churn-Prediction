# ANN-Classification--Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project is a Customer Churn Prediction system built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for binary classification. It predicts whether a customer is likely to leave a bank based on their demographic and financial information. The trained model is deployed using a Streamlit web application for interactive use.
# 🚀 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical problem in the banking sector. This project uses deep learning (ANN) to analyze customer behavior and predict churn probability, helping banks take proactive retention measures.
The system:
Accepts customer details through a web interface
Processes inputs using the same preprocessing pipeline as training
Outputs churn probability and final prediction in real time
